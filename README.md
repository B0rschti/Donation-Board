# Donation Board
This application was build to monitor and organise the donation of clothes and other items for refugees in our local
town. Some functions are missing, only German is supported at this point and the installation of the database on windows can be a little bit tricky. Best is
you test it, and if it fits your needs, use it ;). Otherwise, feel free to contribute and help me to make this app
more easy to setup and work with.

Installation:
=============

- install MongoDB, NodeJS and Bower
- go to the app folder
- run "npm install" to install the dependencies
- run "bower install" to install frontend dependencies
- run "npm start" to start your local server 
- open your browser and go to localhost:8000

ToDo:
=====

- translations for everything
- Use an emdedded db instead of mongodb
- use relative dates for the history view
